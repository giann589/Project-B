9.4:
Reimplement the Person class from Programming Project 9.22.2 so that the collection of a personâ€™s friends is stored in a vector<Person*>.

9.8:
Add a feature to the CashRegister class for computing sales tax. The tax rate should be supplied when constructing a CashRegister object. Add add_taxable_item and get_total_tax member functions. (Items added with add_item are not taxable.)

10.2:
Add an alarm feature to the Clock class of Programming Project 10.13.1. When set_alarm(hours, minutes) is called, the clock stores the alarm. When you call get_time, and the alarm time has been reached or exceeded, return the time followed by the string "Alarm" (or, if you prefer, the string "\u23F0") and clear the alarm. What do you need to do to make the set_alarm function work for WorldClock objects?
